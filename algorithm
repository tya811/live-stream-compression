say you watch these world surf league events. Here is the basis. 

it takes a lot of physics too and light physics. but basically, you sample the first pixel of each row, use a pseudo random range to describe the variation
in colors and bends and curves of light, and then guess the rest of the colors because they will mostly be similar, 
and then track the surfers and basically draw them and their wake etc onto the wave using random colors and a ton of physics. 

itll take me a bit more thinking, but you also have to take into consideration local weather conditions, wind, and overall what the waves tend to do. 

but you can do the same thing with baseball and football and soccer and stuff like that.
